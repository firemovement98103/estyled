### EStyled Repo

This project is a Styled Components design system developed by Evan Williams (hence e-styled. I'm not clever).

#### To Run

#### Build:
```js
npm run build
```

This will use rollup to transpile & build the project into the dist directory.

#### Development mode:
```js
npm run dev
```

Will run rollup on watch to rebuild the dist directory. It will also launch storybook which will highlight the changes
and use cases for each component.
